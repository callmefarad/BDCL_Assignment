# A man went to a super market with an unknown amount of money, he bought three
# items(soap, milk and juice) and came back with a balance.
# Write a dynamic program that interprets the whole process
# displaying the balance he came back with.

# Enter your solution here:





# let the unknown amount be #2000

x = 2000
items = ['soap', 'milk', 'juice']
price1 = 200
price2 = 500
price3 = 300
total = price1 + price2 + price3
balance = x - total
print(balance)
